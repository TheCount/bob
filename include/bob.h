/**
 * @mainpage BOB â€” binary object files
 *
 *
 * @section intro BOBs, what are they?
 *
 * BOBs are files which represent a single, contiguous block of binary data.
 * The file format is designed to be gentle on the storage medium (especially
 * flash storage with a limited number of write/erase cycles) if the binary data
 * is changed often. In particular, for small changes, only the changes are
 * appended to the original data.
 *
 * BOBs are ideal for small to medium size data (up to to hundreds of
 * kilobytes), or larger data which changes very little. For larger data which
 * changes a lot, you don't need BOBs. Just write out the data and let the
 * system's wear levelling algorithms do their job.
 *
 *
 * @section conf BOB configuration
 *
 * A BOB currently supports the following configuration parameters.
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Block size: the block size of the underlying file system. The default is
 *    zero, in which case an attempt will be made to determine the block size
 *    when the underlying file is created. If no block size can be determined,
 *    a value of 32768 will be assumed, which is safe for most filesystems.
 *    Note that a wrong block size may cause #bob_set to fail if the underlying
 *    file system refuses certain operations.
 *  <li>Cue size: number of data bytes after which data should be written out in
 *    full (rather than just storing changes). Writing the data out in full from
 *    time to time reduces loading times and reduces the risk of file
 *    corruption. The cue size should be a multiple of the block size. The
 *    default is zero, in which case the cue size will be selected to be
 *    1024 times the block size.
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * @section threadsafe Thread safety
 *
 * The functions in this library can be safely called concurrently, as long as
 * the @c BOB and @c BOBConfig arguments are distinct and the memory regions
 * corresponding to passed pointer arguments do not overlap.
 *
 *
 * @section filesafe File safety
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that a BOB file is opened
 * only once at any given time. The library does not attempt to "lock" any file,
 * nor does it use any other means to ensure exclusive access.
